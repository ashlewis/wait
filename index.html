        <p>Lebowski ipsum mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain. Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit. This compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride. D'ya have a good sarsaparilla? Please see him, Jeffrey. He's a good man. And thorough. I know my rights. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake. A fucking goldbricker.</p>

The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options. Yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man. Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. If I can find your money, manâ€” what's in it for the Dude?</p>

        <p>Fuck you man! You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab! Near the In-and-Out Burger. Tomorrow vee come back und cut off your chonson. Hello, Pilar? My name is Walter Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski. Okay, Jackie, done. I like the way you do business. Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure.</p>

        <p>Let me tell you something, pendejo. You pull any your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger til it goes "click". The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight-year-old. Show me what you got. Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.</p>

        <p>I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday. Those are good burgers, Walter. Finishing my coffee. That fucking bitch! A fifteen-year-old? Is this your idea of a joke? That's fuckin' combat. The man in the black pyjamas, Dude. Worthy fuckin' adversary. People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone.</p>
